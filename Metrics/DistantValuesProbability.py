    Calculate Distant Values Probability (DVP) following SynthCity implementation.

    DVP measures the inverse probability that a synthetic individual has a large 
    distance to real individuals. It calculates the proportion of real individuals 
    that have normalized distances >= t to their nearest synthetic neighbor.

    DVP(Y, Z) = 1 - (Σ 1[^D_E(y, NN_E(y, Z)) >= t]) / n

    Args:
        _real_data: Real dataset

    Returns:
        float: DVP score (lower = better privacy)
