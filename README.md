# PrivEval: a tool for interactive evaluation of privacy metrics in synthetic data generation

![alt text](https://github.com/hereditary-eu/PrivEval/tree/main/images/PrivEval_model.pdf)

PrivEval, a tool for assisting users in evaluating the privacy properties of a synthetic dataset.
Here, the user can explore how privacy is estimated through privacy metrics as well as their applicability for specific scenarios and the implications thereof.
This means that PrivEval is a first step to bridge the gap between privacy experts and the general public for making privacy estimation more transparent.

| Nearest Neighbour Adversarial Accuracy | NNAA estimates the risk of identifying whether an individual contributed their data to the real dataset while only having access to the synthetic data. This is done by mapping the datasets to 2D and estimated using distances to nearest neoghbors.                                                                   |

## Requirements
The input datasets must be single table CSV files with no individuals repeating in the dataset for correct metric calculation.
The input datasets must not contain missing values

## Other information

A python notebook is available to generate the real and synthetic dataset using the file gen_dataset.ipynb.

For some metrics, we refer to their individual implementations in the Metrics folder to change e.g. thresholds and iterations.
